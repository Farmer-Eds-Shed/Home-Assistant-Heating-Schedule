This is the Heating portion of my Home Assitant configuration.
It uses Tuya thermostats and switches to control the heating and to give physical wall controls.
Tuya devices are all stock firmware with local control via a modified [LocalTuya](https://github.com/rospogrigio/localtuya) custom component.
Additional temperature sensors based on [MySensors.org](https://MySensors.org) are also used for room and water temperature monitoring.
