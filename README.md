This is the Heating portion of my Home Assitant Configuration.
I'm using Tuya thermostats and switches to control the heating and give physical wall controls.
Tuya Devices are all stock firmware with local control via a modified localtuya custom component.
Additional Temperature sensors based on MySensors.org are also used for room and water temperature monitoring.
