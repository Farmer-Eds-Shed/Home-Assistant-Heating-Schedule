/*
 * The MySensors Arduino library handles the wireless radio link and protocol
 * between your home built sensors/actuators and HA controller of choice.
 * The sensors forms a self healing radio network with optional repeaters. Each
 * repeater and gateway builds a routing tables in EEPROM which keeps track of the
 * network topology allowing messages to be routed to nodes.

 *******************************
 *
 * REVISION HISTORY
 * Version 1.0 - Henrik Ekblad
 * Contribution by a-lurker and Anticimex,
 * Contribution by Norbert Truchsess <norbert.truchsess@t-online.de>
 * Contribution by Ivo Pullens (ESP8266 support)
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * The EthernetGateway sends data received from sensors to the WiFi link.
 * The gateway also accepts input on ethernet interface, which is then sent out to the radio network.
 *
 * VERA CONFIGURATION:
 * Enter "ip-number:port" in the ip-field of the Arduino GW device. This will temporarily override any serial configuration for the Vera plugin.
 * E.g. If you want to use the default values in this sketch enter: 192.168.178.66:5003
 *
 * LED purposes:
 * - To use the feature, uncomment any of the MY_DEFAULT_xx_LED_PINs in your sketch, only the LEDs that is defined is used.
 * - RX (green) - blink fast on radio message received. In inclusion mode will blink fast only on presentation received
 * - TX (yellow) - blink fast on radio message transmitted. In inclusion mode will blink slowly
 * - ERR (red) - fast blink on error during transmission error or receive crc error
 *
 * See https://www.mysensors.org/build/connect_radio for wiring instructions.
 *
 * If you are using a "barebone" ESP8266, see
 * https://www.mysensors.org/build/esp8266_gateway#wiring-for-barebone-esp8266
 *
 * Inclusion mode button:
 * - Connect GPIO5 (=D1) via switch to GND ('inclusion switch')
 *
 * Hardware SHA204 signing is currently not supported!
 *
 * Make sure to fill in your ssid and WiFi password below for ssid & pass.
